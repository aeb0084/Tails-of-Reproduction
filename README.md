Reproductive-Regenerative Trade-offs in the Brown Anole. 

This repository holds all supplemental files for "Tails of Reproduction:  Regeneration leads to increased reproductive investment".

## Abstract: 
"Tradeoffs between life-history traits are predicted due to limited resource allocation or constraints in the regulation of genetic and physiological networks. Life history theory suggests that investment into regenerating tissue may lead to a tradeoff with life-history traits, such as reproduction, but previous research has shown contradicting results. Tail autotomy, with subsequent regeneration, is a common anti-predation mechanism in lizards. In this study, we utilize the brown anole lizard with its relatively unique reproductive pattern, of single-egg clutches every 7-10 days, to test for a tradeoff in reproductive investment over eight weeks of tail regeneration on a limited diet. In contrast to our hypothesis, we found that investing in tissue regeneration had a positive effect on reproduction in terms of egg and hatchling size, and no effect on egg number or survival. Specifically, relative to the first four weeks of regeneration, during the last four weeks regenerating females produced 7.6% larger eggs and 17.2% heavier hatchlings; further, relative to controls, regenerating females produced 11.7% larger eggs and 11.5% heavier hatchlings. We discuss these results in the context of mechanistic hypotheses that the process of regeneration may cause increased metabolic efficiency or utilized shared physiological pathways with reproductive investment."
